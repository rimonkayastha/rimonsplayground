                        Illustrated for my 10th grade school magazine, 'A Student's Battle' depicts parallels between a student and a warrior. The comic compares exams to battles as the student takes their pen to overcome their paper like how a warrior uses their sword to slay the dragon.

                        11th grade, just completed Python, PySimpleGUI, Pygame. Received an assignment to make anything with python, ANYTHING. What would any sane person do? Make a game, ofc. And even better if it's one you played as a kid, right? Haven't you ever felt like the game is rigged. Why does paper even beat rock? It doesn't make sense. Well this game gives the player a chance to redeem Rock's lost glory! To beat Paper like it was always meant to be.

                        When I first thought about creating my portfolio, I immediately realized that I wanted to create something which is a fusion of all of my interests. Whether it be art, or music, or robotics, or content creation, Rimon's playground would be the home to everything I've created, no matter how random they are. So, I thought, why not create a home page which represents EXACTLY what I mean. My playground, my desk full of playthings, with which I create what I love.
